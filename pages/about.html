        <h3 class="subtitle">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Computer Science Society (CSS) at the UWI Cavehill Campus is a dynamic student organization dedicated
            to fostering a supportive and innovative community for students pursuing degrees in technological fields,
            including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electronics, and IT, but all will be welcomed. Our aim is
            to
            bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge acquired in academic settings and real-world applications in
            the tech industry.</p>
